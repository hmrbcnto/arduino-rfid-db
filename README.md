This program was written with VisualBasic, with an sqlite3 as a database. 

The purpose of this program was to create a GUI that takes an RFID code from an arduino with a RFID Scanner that initially allows an unrecognized RFID tag/card to be registered into the system, recording its name and other personal data. Subsequent readings of a registered RFID tag will display the information related to the RFID tag.

This program was written at the request of a professor from my college.
